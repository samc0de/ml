# ml
This repository holds learning, practice and experimental programs for machine learning.

It is supposed to be a superproject for all ML repos I have, or will have. It will probably have submodules, such as TF, theano, pytorch, caffee, keras, reinforcement learning, NN, my_ideas, github pages, notes etc
